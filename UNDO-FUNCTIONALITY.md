# Undo Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Added undo functionality to reverse incorrect scans in warehouse workflows where it provides the most value.

## Implemented Undo Features

### 1. **Picking Workflow** - High Priority ✅
- **Undo item scans**: Reverse incorrect item picks
- **Functionality**: Decrements picked quantity back to previous state
- **Use case**: Worker scans wrong item or scans too many of same item
- **Trigger**: Click "↶ Undo" button or Ctrl+Z

### 2. **Stock Count Workflow** - High Priority ✅
- **Undo quantity entries**: Reverse count entries
- **Functionality**: Restores previous counted quantity (including null/uncounted state)
- **Use case**: Worker enters wrong count for an item
- **Trigger**: Click "↶ Undo" button or Ctrl+Z

### 3. **Location Move Workflow** - Medium Priority ✅
- **Undo step navigation**: Go back to previous workflow step
- **Functionality**: Returns to previous step (confirmation → item scan → destination scan)
- **Use case**: Worker scans wrong item or wrong location
- **Trigger**: Click "↶ Undo" button or Ctrl+Z

### 4. **Returns Workflow** - Medium Priority ✅
- **Undo step navigation**: Go back to previous workflow step
- **Functionality**: Returns to source location scan from destination scan
- **Use case**: Worker scans wrong source location
- **Trigger**: Click "↶ Undo" button or Ctrl+Z

## Technical Implementation

### Undo Stack Management
```javascript
// Each workflow manager maintains an undo stack
this.undoStack = [];
this.maxUndoSteps = 10; // Limit memory usage

// Save state before each action
this.saveUndoState('pick_item', {
    itemBarcode: barcode,
    previousQuantity: orderItem.quantity_picked,
    itemName: orderItem.name
});
```

### Action Types Supported
- `pick_item`: Picking workflow item scans
- `count_item`: Stock count quantity entries  
- `location_move_step`: Location move workflow steps
- `returns_step`: Returns workflow steps

### UI Integration
- **Undo Button**: Appears in header when actions are available to undo
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac)
- **Visual Feedback**: Success messages confirm what was undone
- **Auto-hide**: Button disappears when no actions to undo

## Usage Examples

### Picking Workflow
1. Scan `ord_1001` to start picking
2. Scan `itm_501` (item gets picked: 1/5)
3. Scan `itm_501` again (item gets picked: 2/5)
4. Click "↶ Undo" → quantity returns to 1/5
5. Click "↶ Undo" again → quantity returns to 0/5

### Stock Count Workflow
1. Scan `stc_2001` to start stock count
2. Scan `itm_501` and enter count "15"
3. Click "↶ Undo" → item returns to "not counted" state
4. Scan `itm_501` again and enter correct count

### Location Move Workflow
1. Scan `loc_3001` and confirm move
2. Scan wrong item `itm_999`
3. Click "↶ Undo" → returns to item scan step
4. Scan correct item

## Benefits

### For Warehouse Workers
- **Error Recovery**: Quick fix for scanning mistakes
- **Confidence**: Less fear of making mistakes
- **Efficiency**: No need to cancel entire workflow for small errors
- **Intuitive**: Familiar Ctrl+Z shortcut

### For Operations
- **Accuracy**: Reduces data entry errors
- **Speed**: Faster error correction vs. workflow restart
- **Training**: Easier for new workers to learn
- **Audit Trail**: Actions are logged with timestamps

## Limitations

### Intentional Scope Limits
- **No multi-step undo chains**: Each undo is single action
- **No undo after completion**: Cannot undo completed workflows
- **Memory limited**: Maximum 10 undo actions stored
- **Session only**: Undo stack clears on workflow reset

### Workflows Not Included
- **Final confirmations**: Cannot undo "Complete Order" or "Execute Move"
- **Cross-workflow**: Cannot undo across different workflow types
- **System actions**: Cannot undo automatic state changes

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Pick multiple items then undo each**
2. **Enter wrong count then undo**
3. **Navigate location move steps with undo**
4. **Test undo button visibility**
5. **Test keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Z)**
6. **Test undo stack limit (10 actions)**

### Error Cases
- Undo with empty stack → shows warning
- Undo invalid action type → shows warning
- Undo after workflow completion → button hidden

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Redo functionality**: Ctrl+Y to redo undone actions
- **Undo history**: Show list of recent actions
- **Bulk undo**: Undo multiple actions at once
- **Persistent undo**: Survive workflow resets
- **Audio feedback**: Sound confirmation for undo actions

### Integration Ideas
- **Audit logging**: Track undo actions for compliance
- **Analytics**: Monitor error patterns
- **Permissions**: Role-based undo restrictions
- **Confirmation**: Require confirmation for critical undos

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- `workflows.js`: Added undo stack management and action handlers
- `index.html`: Added undo button to header
- `app.js`: Added Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut

### New Methods Added
- `saveUndoState()`: Save action for potential undo
- `undoLastAction()`: Execute undo operation
- `undoPickItem()`: Specific undo for picking actions
- `undoCountItem()`: Specific undo for count actions
- `undoLocationMoveStep()`: Specific undo for location moves
- `undoReturnsStep()`: Specific undo for returns
- `showUndoButton()` / `hideUndoButton()`: UI management

### Minimal Code Impact
- **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality unchanged
- **Opt-in feature**: Only activates when actions are performed
- **Memory efficient**: Limited stack size and cleanup on reset
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for state saving
