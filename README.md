# Warehouse Barcode Scanner

A complete browser-based barcode scanning application for warehouse operations built according to the specifications in PROJECT-README.md and WORKFLOW-SPEC.md.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Technology Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
- BarcodeDetector API for native scanning
- getUserMedia API for camera access

### ✅ All 4 Workflows
1. **Picking Workflow** (`ord_` prefix) - Order fulfillment
2. **Stock Count Workflow** (`stc_` prefix) - Inventory counting
3. **Location Move Workflow** (`loc_` prefix) - Item relocation
4. **Returns Workflow** (`itm_` prefix) - Processing returns

### ✅ Camera Controls
- Zoom control with persistent settings
- Flashlight toggle (if supported)
- Focus control and settings panel
- Half-screen collapsible camera interface

### ✅ Workflow State Management
- Only one workflow active at a time
- Strict barcode prefix validation
- Proper error messages for wrong barcode types
- Global cancel button always available

### ✅ Mock Data
- Complete test data for all workflows
- Helper functions for data access
- Barcode validation and routing

### ✅ PWA Features
- Web App Manifest for mobile installation
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Responsive design optimized for mobile

### ✅ Test Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test-barcodes.html page
- Visual barcodes for all workflows
- Manual input for testing
- Error scenario testing

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   - Open `index.html` in Chrome 83+ or Edge 83+
   - Allow camera permissions when prompted
   - Click "Start Camera" to begin scanning

2. **Test Workflows**
   - Visit `test-barcodes.html` for visual test barcodes
   - Follow the test sequences for each workflow
   - Use manual input for quick testing

3. **Workflow Examples**
   - Scan `ord_1001` to start picking workflow
   - Scan `stc_2001` to start stock count workflow
   - Scan `loc_3001` to start location move workflow
   - Scan `itm_505` (when no workflow active) to start returns

## Key Implementation Details

### Strict Workflow Validation
- When picking workflow is active, only `itm_` barcodes are accepted
- Wrong barcode types show "Item doesn't exist in order"
- Similar validation for all other workflows

### Camera Management
- Persistent zoom settings saved to localStorage
- Automatic camera capability detection
- Proper resource cleanup on stop

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for each workflow state
- Graceful degradation when APIs not supported
- User-friendly feedback for all actions

## Browser Requirements

- **Chrome 83+** (Recommended)
- **Edge 83+** (Recommended)
- **HTTPS required** for camera access (except localhost)

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive test scenarios:

1. **Picking Test**: Load order → Pick items → Complete
2. **Stock Count Test**: Load count → Count items → Complete
3. **Location Move Test**: Source → Item → Destination → Confirm
4. **Returns Test**: Item → Destination → Confirm
5. **Error Testing**: Wrong barcode types during active workflows

All workflows have been implemented exactly as specified in WORKFLOW-SPEC.md with proper state management and error handling.
